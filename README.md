# treehouse-project-4-Store-Inventory
In this project, I created a store inventory with the following processes: Models, SQLite, csv imports, and csv exports. Each were utilized to:

- look at an existing csv file
- import it into a created database
- create a menu for people to interact with the database
- view and add products in the inventory
- create a back up csv with any changes made to the database
